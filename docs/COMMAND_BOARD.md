# FFL Medical Centre — Command Board

Quick reference for daily work. For locked flow status, architecture, and decisions, see FFL_Medical_Centre_Master_Design.md instead — this file does not duplicate that content. For the full pre-production audit findings, see docs/DAY10_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md. For the full Phase 4 (My Profile) design — every decision, field ownership rule, and state machine — see docs/PHASE4_DESIGN.md; this file only summarizes what shipped.

**Note on this revision (Day 14):** Phases 3 and 4 are now closed. Phase 4 in particular grew far beyond its original 5-step scope during live testing — a second round of fixes (7 issues) and a third round found during final review (3 more, including a real security bug) were folded in before closing it. See the Phase 4 entry below for the full shape of what actually shipped versus what was originally planned.

**Note on this revision (Day 15):** Phase 5 (Ambulance) grew the same way Phase 4 did — started as a gap/bug audit, ended as a near-total redesign after live testing surfaced real bugs and a full design discussion reshaped the operational model. Design is locked in `docs/PHASE5_DESIGN.md`, build sequence is broken into subphases 5.1–5.8 below. Locked but flexible — on-the-go improvements can be incorporated as build progresses; pending open items are deferred to time of need, not blocking the sequence.

## Quick Paths
- NAS project: /mnt/storage/projects/ffl-medical-centre/
- Frontend: app/src/  |  Backend: functions/src/
- GitHub: AwaizFatima08/FFL-Medical-Centre-App (private)
- Firebase project: ffl-medical-centre-app
- Web app: https://ffl-medical-centre-app.web.app
- Dev server: 192.168.100.122:8081 (Expo) | VS Code: 192.168.100.122:8080

## Daily Commands
*(unchanged — see repo history for full command list: dev server, deploy web/functions/rules, EAS build, backup script)*

**Reminder added Day 14:** `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` is a separate deploy from functions/hosting and is easy to forget — a rules-only fix (as happened this session with the blood donor registry bug) does nothing live until this runs.

---

## Scope for V1 completion (locked, Day 13)

**In scope — 10 confirmed modules:**
User signup & validation, Family flow, Ambulance flow, Medical trip, Doctor availability, Doctor directory, Blood donor database, Notices & circulars, Patient feedback, Fitness scheduling. Reports is a cross-cutting view over these, not a separate module.

**Explicitly deferred to V2 — no exceptions:**
Vaccination flow, Lab module, Store/Pharmacy module, and any new idea or module raised during this review. Enhancements to the 10 in-scope modules found while evaluating them for gaps remain in scope; anything outside them does not.

**Standing decision:** No rushed publish. First public release should be impactful — quality over speed.

---

## Confirmed Feature Status (Day 14 update)

| Feature | Prior status said | Actual status |
|---|---|---|
| Family module | "Not yet built (V1 scope)" | **Built and functional** — 4 screens, full pending-revision approval flow, backend routes live |
| Report frontend screens | "Backend done, frontend pending" | **Built** — 7 report screens exist, matching 7 backend endpoints (correctness not yet verified — see Phase 10) |
| My Profile (employee self-service fields) | "Confirmed missing on both employee and admin side" | **Built and closed Day 14** — see Phase 4 |

## Way Forward — V1 Completion (Phases 1–10)

### Phase 1 — Confirmed live bugs — **CLOSED Day 13**
- [x] Residence Type split by branch (family vs bachelor) + bachelor question reworded to "Are you living in township bachelor accommodation?" — closed, tested, confirmed on both branches
- [x] Blood Donor Directory blocks admin & employee — role array in `blood-donors/:bloodGroup` route expanded to all 9 roles — closed, tested (manual `bloodDonorRegistry` test doc), confirmed both name/employee-number/phone displaying correctly
- [x] Blood Donor Directory missing employee number — added to write in both `employeeRoutes.js` (`PUT /:employeeId`) and `authRoutes.js` (`POST /complete-profile`, a second write path to the same collection, found and fixed in the same pass) and to read (`blood-donors` route) — closed, tested
- [x] ESB designation dropdown returns empty list — case mismatch fixed in both `app/src/constants.js` and `functions/src/constants.js` (`EMPLOYEE_TYPES.ESB` aligned to live `'ESB'`, `getDesignationsByType` now case-insensitive) — closed, verified live at Phase 4 (Employee Type chip selector)
- [x] Fitness report always shows zero for fit/unfit/conditional — `reportRoutes.js` `/fitness` route now reads `fitnessOutcome`; third bucket renamed `conditional` → `fit_with_restrictions` to match the real value — closed

### Phase 2 — Trip reports structural fix — **CLOSED Day 13**
- [x] Confirmed root cause: `reportRoutes.js` queried a `medicalTrips` collection (with `bookings` subcollection) that does not exist in live Firestore. Real data is flat, top-level `tripBookings`.
- [x] Rewrote `/trip-day`, `/trips/monthly`, `/trips` to query `tripBookings` directly
- [x] Added `getHospitalMap` helper — batched `doctorId` → `doctorDirectory.hospital` lookup
- [x] Found and fixed two additional bugs during the rewrite: seat counting summed booking count instead of `seats` field; status filter compared against a `BOOKING_STATUS.APPROVED` value that never appears in live data (real value is `'confirmed'`)
- [x] Required a new Firestore composite index (`tripBookings`: `status` + `tripDate`) — created, confirmed enabled, `firestore.indexes.json` re-exported
- [x] Verified live against May 2026 data
- [ ] Still not live-verified: Trip Day Report and the general `/trips` route — low risk (same query pattern as the verified route) but genuinely untested; carry forward to Phase 10

### Phase 3 — Code-only consistency fixes — **CLOSED Day 14**
Scope grew beyond the original 3 bullet points once live Firestore was checked field-by-field rather than assumed correct from the schema doc.
- [x] Marital status: `constants.js` `'single'` → `'unmarried'`, reordered to match live (`married, unmarried, divorced, widowed`) — both frontend and backend
- [x] Department/unit casing: 5 values corrected in `DEPARTMENT_GROUPS`, flat `DEPARTMENTS` list, and `UNITS` keys (`Admin`→`admin`, `Production_N`→`Production_n`, `Maintenance`→`maintenance`, `Process_Engineering`→`process_Engineering`, `Project_Engineering`→`project_Engineering`)
- [x] Designation lists corrected to match live Firestore exactly, not just the originally-scoped "low priority" items:
  - Management: added missing `Senior_Engineer_M9A`, fixed `Graduate_Trainee_Engineer_M5` value to the real `GTE_M5`
  - Non-Management: removed `Apprentice_Technician` (not in live config)
  - ESB: dropped the `ESB_` prefix from all values (live has none), removed `Head_Master` (not live), added `Supervisor` (live has it, code didn't)
- [x] **`UNITS` values — found to be more than a casing issue.** Several were factually wrong or missing entirely against live data, not just mis-cased: Maintenance had 7 fictional `_Field` units and was missing 7 real `_Machinery` units; HSEQT had `LDC` instead of `Learning_Development_Centre`; Project Engineering had `Civil_Plant` instead of `Civil_Plantsite`; E&I was a single placeholder instead of its 3 real units (Electrical/Instrument/Control_Systems); ESB was empty instead of having one real value; AIM was a placeholder instead of the real `Inspection`. All corrected to match live data exactly.
- [x] **Live Firestore itself corrected, not just code:** `units` map had 4 keys cased differently from the `departments` array values they're supposed to key against (`Maintenance`/`Production_N`/`Process_Engineering`/`Project_Engineering` vs. the array's lowercase-first versions) — this would have broken the live cascading dropdown regardless of any code fix, since the live data itself was internally inconsistent. Renamed directly in the Firestore console. A duplicate `"admin"` entry in the `admin` units array was also cleaned up.
- **Process note:** this phase is the reason Phase 4's later screens were built against verified live data via raw Firestore exports rather than the schema doc alone — the schema doc alone wasn't reliable enough once several factual (not just cosmetic) mismatches turned up here.

### Phase 4 — My Profile — **CLOSED Day 14**
Full design in `docs/PHASE4_DESIGN.md`. Originally scoped as 5 steps (cascading dropdowns → blood group/CNIC → blood donor consent → chronic disease → picture upload). What actually shipped is substantially larger — the design changed direction mid-build (admin-enters/employee-confirms instead of employee-submits/admin-approves) and three rounds of live testing surfaced real bugs, including one security issue that had been silently failing since it was introduced.

**Core build (Steps A–G):**
- [x] Backend hardened — employee self-edit of admin-owned fields (department/designation/blood group/CNIC/unit/employeeType) blocked at both the Express layer and, separately, at the Firestore rules layer (field-level `hasOnly()` restriction) — the two layers were found to disagree until the rules fix, meaning a direct client write could have bypassed the Express-only restriction
- [x] `/complete-profile` repurposed into `/confirm-profile` — employee confirms admin-entered data + sets blood donor consent, doesn't self-enter identity fields
- [x] Signup: added CNIC, marital status, smoker status (all three captured once at signup; CNIC locked after, marital status and smoker status stay self-editable)
- [x] Admin approval screen: full profile-data entry at approval time (Employee Type → Department → Unit → Designation cascade, Blood Group, Chronic Disease) — admin enters from HR records, employee only confirms
- [x] My Profile screen: two states (pre-confirmation review + confirm, post-confirmation view with self-editable marital status/smoker status/blood donor consent)
- [x] **Chronic disease moved to a protected subcollection** (`employees/{id}/private/medical`) after discovering the `employees` collection's open read rule meant a plain field would have been readable by any authenticated user, not just admin/CMO as intended — Firestore rules can't hide one field within an otherwise-open document, so this needed a real structural fix, not a rule tweak
- [x] Family tab alert system: tile badge, admin "Family Status" tab (flagged-employee list, manual re-flag with note, Mark Complete), auto-flagging on marriage transition
- [x] Admin spouse/child disable flow — Deceased/Divorced reason picker for spouse (auto-updates marital status to widowed/divorced), deceased-only for children, disabled members shown blurred with a status badge rather than disappearing

**Round 2 fixes (7 issues found in first live test pass):**
- [x] Admin had no way to edit an already-approved employee's data (only role/disable existed) — added full profile-data edit panel to `UserManagementScreen.js`
- [x] Family Status "Mark Complete" was unreachable for married-at-signup employees — Firestore's `in` filter never matches a missing field, and `familyDataStatus` was never set at signup; fixed by setting it explicitly at signup, plus adding Mark Complete to the manual-search path as a fallback
- [x] Chronic disease changed from free text to a fixed multi-select (Diabetes, Hypertension, Ischemic Heart Disease, Deranged Lipid Profile)
- [x] Smoker status added (signup + self-edit)
- [x] Family member blood donor consent — was entirely missing despite being in the original Phase 4 plan ("employee + family")
- [x] Disabled family members were disappearing from admin's view instead of showing blurred/disabled
- [x] Employee had no route to report incorrect data post-approval, only "confirm or nothing" — added a correction-request note, visible to admin on `UserManagementScreen.js` with a Mark Resolved action

**Round 3 fixes (3 issues found in final review pass):**
- [x] The correction-request option only existed on the *post*-confirmation screen — an employee who saw wrong data on first login had no way forward except falsely confirming. Added the same report option to the pre-confirmation screen.
- [x] Family member blood donor consent toggle was active for minors — disabled (not hidden) for family members under 18, with an explanatory hint
- [x] **Real bug:** family member consent toggles updated the family member's own record correctly but silently failed to create the `bloodDonorRegistry` entry the Directory actually reads from — a Firestore rules mismatch (registry doc IDs for family members don't equal the writer's own uid, which the original rule required). Fixed with an ownership lookup in the rule. **Any family member consent set before this rules fix was deployed needs to be re-toggled off/on to actually appear in the directory** — flagged to Homi, several test records needed this.

**Process notes carried forward from this phase:**
- When adding any new self-service write path, check the Firestore rules layer explicitly, not just the Express backend — the two are independent enforcement points and this phase found them disagreeing twice (admin-owned field self-edit; family member registry writes)
- When building an employee-level feature, check whether family members need the analogous feature before considering the module done — blood donor consent was in the original plan for both and only the employee half got built initially
- Verify live Firestore data directly (raw export) before building UI that assumes a schema doc is accurate — Phase 3 already established this, Phase 4 confirmed it again

### Phase 5 — Ambulance flow redesign — **subphases locked, Day 15**
Originally scoped as a standard gap/bug audit. Live testing (screenshots covering employee/reception/driver flows, cancellation, notifications, completion) plus a full design discussion with Homi turned it into a near-total redesign of the operational model. Full design in `docs/PHASE5_DESIGN.md` — this entry only tracks build sequence and status. Execute one subphase at a time — fix, verify live, move to next. Do not batch.

**Confirmed during code review + live screenshots (not redesign, just real bugs):**
- Firestore rules gap: `ambulanceRequests` update rule currently allows any `employee` role to directly write any field via client SDK, bypassing all backend role/state logic — same category as the Phase 4 rules-vs-Express mismatch
- "Purpose of Visit" (Emergency/Routine Consultation/Physiotherapy/Dental/Lab Sample) is captured on both request screens but never persisted by the backend — confirmed live: testers have been typing the purpose into the free-text Condition/Complaint field as a workaround (e.g. "Dental Visit" appearing as the condition)
- Employee cannot view their own submitted request (`GET /:id` excludes `employee` role) or cancel it while pending (only reception/CMO/assigned driver can cancel)
- Neither CMO nor Doctor home screen has any ambulance tile — confirmed via live screenshots of both dashboards

**Operating reality the redesign is built around:** one driver per shift (not one per vehicle) — Bolan (general seating, non-AC, within-township) and Hiace/BLS (stretcher, paramedic-equipped) can never both be in motion at once. No dedicated emergency driver exists or is planned near-term; vehicle-switching cost during an emergency is an accepted limitation, not something this app solves.

**Subphase sequence:**
- [ ] **5.1 — Firestore rules fix** — lock down `ambulanceRequests` update rule to match backend's actual role/state logic. No dependencies; cheapest to close first.
- [ ] **5.2 — Purpose of Visit persistence** — save the field backend currently drops; surface it properly on dispatch cards/detail screen instead of relying on it being smuggled into Condition/Complaint.
- [ ] **5.3 — Family member dropdown** — replace free-text Patient Name with family dropdown on employee + reception request screens; excludes disabled family members (deceased/divorced spouse, admin-disabled child). **Requires `EmployeeHome.js` review first** — not yet seen, needed to check current ambulance tile gating.
- [ ] **5.4 — Single system-wide queue + emergency bypass** — one active-trip slot, only one driver/vehicle can be physically dispatched at a time (lock is at `dispatched`→`completed`, not `accepted` — reception can freely accept/triage multiple pending requests, the exclusivity applies only at the dispatch step; corrected during build per Homi's clarification). Reception's on-behalf-of auto-accept now also respects the lock — previously always auto-accepted, which let reception bypass it. Employee sees plain queue-position number, no ETA (deliberately dropped — a wrong time estimate creates a new complaint, a queue number is always honest). Structural core the remaining subphases sit on. **Built, not yet live-verified.**
- [ ] **5.5 — Employee-side self-service** — view own request, cancel own request while still pending, block duplicate active request per patient (not a lifetime limit — only while a prior request for that same patient is still open).
- [ ] **5.6 — Return-to-home tab** — new reception-only category, separate from main request flow, drop-off defaults to registered house number, mergeable with a subsequent pickup in the same drive.
- [ ] **5.7 — Emergency mid-route diversion** — driver decides divert-now vs. return-to-base; boarded routine patient decides board-off-here vs. return to Medical Centre (patient's call, not reception's — no approval delay); trip marked `Complete` directly from `picked_up` (new allowed-from state for the Complete action, not a new status — deliberately not over-engineered since a mid-route drop-off is a maximum ~20 min walk in the township). Deliberately last among core items — depends on 5.4 and the `picked_up`→`Complete` change being stable.
- [ ] **5.8 — CMO / Doctor ambulance dashboard** — scope (live operational view / historical / both) still open, decide before wireframing. Check whether the existing unwired `reportRoutes.js` `/ambulance` route (flagged in Phase 10's orphaned-routes list) already covers part of this before building new report logic.

**Still open, to resolve at time of need (not blocking the sequence above):**
- Reception's ability to reclassify a false "Emergency" after the fact — raised in discussion, never resolved
- ~~Queue-position scope (system-wide vs. per-vehicle-type)~~ — resolved during 5.4 build: system-wide, confirmed in `getActiveQueue()` comment in `ambulanceRoutes.js`
- **Day 16, raised during 5.4 build:** scheduled 4 AM auto-cancel of stale `pending` requests, as an ongoing safety net (separate from the one-time manual cleanup already done before 5.4 deployed). Logged for later analysis — not built, may be dropped after review.

**V2 backlog additions from this discussion (not this phase):**
- GPS tracking of vehicle, visible to reception
- WhatsApp integration — automated messages to employees waiting in queue
- Driver-side dashboard with queue visibility and emergency auto-alert — design deferred until 5.1–5.8 above are built and live-verified; when designed, must be designed together with 5.7 since they're the same operational moment from two different screens

### Phase 6 — Doctor Availability review
- [ ] Not yet reviewed this session — audit screens + backend routes for gaps/bugs within scope

### Phase 7 — Doctor Directory review
- [ ] Not yet reviewed this session — audit screens + backend routes for gaps/bugs within scope

### Phase 8 — Notices & Circulars review
- [ ] Not yet reviewed this session — audit screens + backend routes for gaps/bugs within scope

### Phase 9 — Patient Feedback review
- [ ] Confirmed bug (found Day 13): `reportRoutes.js`'s `/feedback` route reads field names that don't match the real schema (`ratings.staffBehaviour`, `ratings.housekeeping`, `ratings.waitingTime`, `suggestion` vs. what the route reads). Same shape of bug as the Phase 1 Fitness report fix. Feedback averages/report have likely never shown correct data.
- [ ] Screens (`FeedbackDetailScreen.js`, `FeedbackFormScreen.js`, `FeedbackListScreen.js`) not yet reviewed — audit for further gaps/bugs within scope

### Phase 10 — Reports review
- [ ] Run all 7 report screens post Phase 2/3/4 fixes and confirm each returns correct live data — now includes checking whether any report should reflect the new My Profile fields (department/designation/blood group are now reliably populated where they weren't before)
- [ ] 5 `reportRoutes.js` routes with no frontend tile (`/fitness`, `/ambulance`, `/trips`, `/vaccination`, `/feedback`) — decide build-vs-remove per route (Fitness/Ambulance/Feedback in-scope, Vaccination is V2)
- [ ] Assess requirement for any new reports, remaining within scope
- [ ] Deliberately held until after Phase 4 (now closed) so reports can be reviewed against the complete employee data model

---

## Design decisions — CLOSED, unchanged
- [x] Header/logout layout — driver accepted as intentional one-off
- [x] Employee pink tiles vs. white — kept as-is per Homi's stated priority (employee = actual customer, gets design investment)

## Process notes
- Before opening a new phase, re-run a fresh live test of the previous phase's fixes to confirm nothing regressed — held throughout Phases 1–4
- One issue at a time, full verification after each
- Complete file replacements over partial edits remains the default; surgical edits only for genuinely minor single-line changes
- **Added Day 14:** live-testing in rounds (build → test → fix → re-test) surfaced real bugs at every round in Phase 4, including a security issue in round 3 that wouldn't have been caught by code review alone — this round-based testing discipline is worth keeping for future phases, not just Phase 4

## Explicitly out of scope for V1
- Vaccination flow (full — catch-up, adult, nurse-driven)
- Nurse, lab_technologist, pharmacy_incharge full flows
- Non-entitled resident relatives flow (logged to V2 backlog, enriched Day 14 with relation types and field list)
- Homecare Medical Services Requirement (logged to V2 backlog Day 14, concept only)
- Any other new module or idea raised during this review, however small

## Other pending (unchanged from before)
- Notification debugging — deferred to final pre-production testing round, after Phase 10
